We used Xamarin.Forms & C# as well as Xamarin.iOS or Xamarin.Android when needed.

Our project is a simple shopping app demo with login, list view, product view and searching function. 
The project contains following pages: Welcome Page, Login Page, Categories List Page, Product List Page, Product Page.
